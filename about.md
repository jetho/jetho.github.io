Hi, my name is Jens Thomas. I'm a computer scientist and programmer living near Munich, Germany. 
Among other things, my interests include functional programming, programming language theory, operating systems and electronics.

I created this blog for sharing my learning experiences and other random stuff I'm interested in.
